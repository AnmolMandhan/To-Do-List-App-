# 📝 Advanced To-Do List App (React)

A fully-featured and visually polished task manager built using React. This to-do list app supports all core functionalities expected from a task tracker, along with a smooth, animated UI and persistent local storage.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Add New Task
Users can quickly enter a new task with optional **priority level** and **due date**.

### ✏️ Edit Existing Task
Click the pencil icon to edit the task's text. Save changes with the "Save" button.

### ☑ Mark as Complete
Click a task’s text to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks appear grayed out with a strike-through.

### 🗑 Delete Task
Easily delete any task using the trash icon. Instant removal from the list and local storage.

### ⏫ Priority Selection
Choose from **High (🔥)**, **Medium (⚖)**, or **Low (🧊)** priorities while adding tasks. This helps organize tasks by urgency.

### 📅 Due Date Picker
Assign a due date to each task to track upcoming deadlines.

### 🌗 Dark/Light Theme Toggle
Switch between light and dark mode for better visual comfort. Theme preference is saved across sessions.

### 🎯 Drag-and-Drop Reordering
Tasks can be reordered interactively using drag-and-drop (via `react-beautiful-dnd`). Prioritize visually by reordering as needed.

### 💾 Local Storage Persistence
All tasks, theme mode, and their states are saved in the browser’s `localStorage` to persist after page reloads.

### 🎨 Modern & Animated UI
Smooth hover and scaling effects give the app a professional, clean, and user-friendly appearance.
